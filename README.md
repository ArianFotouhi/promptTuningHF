# **Prompt Tuning Application**

This application demonstrates how prompt tuning can modify the behavior of a language model to generate more contextually appropriate and targeted responses to specific prompts.

---

## **Overview**

Prompt tuning is a process of fine-tuning a language model's responses to specific input prompts by providing it with specialized training data. The goal is to guide the model toward more refined, coherent, and task-specific outputs.

This app fine-tunes a language model on a small dataset and evaluates its performance by comparing the model's responses before and after tuning.


# Dataset example

| Act                          | Prompt                                                                                              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| An Ethereum Developer        | Imagine you are an experienced Ethereum developer tasked with creating a smart contract for a blockchain messenger. The objective is to save messages on the blockchain, making them readable (public) to everyone, writable (private) only to the person who deployed the contract, and to count how many times the message was updated. Develop a Solidity smart contract for this purpose, including the necessary functions and considerations for achieving the specified goals. Please provide the code and any relevant explanations to ensure a clear understanding of the implementation. |
| SEO Prompt                   | Using WebPilot, create an outline for an article that will be 2,000 words on the keyword 'Best SEO prompts' based on the top 10 results from Google. Include every relevant heading possible. Keep the keyword density of the headings high. For each section of the outline, include the word count. Include FAQs section in the outline too, based on people also ask section from Google for the keyword. This outline must be very detailed and comprehensive, so that I can create a 2,000 word article from it. Generate a long list of LSI and NLP keywords related to my keyword. Also include any other words related to the keyword. Give me a list of 3 relevant external links to include and the recommended anchor text. Make sure theyâ€™re not competing articles. Split the outline into part 1 and part 2. |
| Linux Terminal               | I want you to act as a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is pwd |

#### **Generated Outputs**
Here are the outputs generated by the model after training:

- **Prompt**: *I want you to act as a motivational coach.*
  - **Generated**:  
    *I want you to act as a motivational coach. I will provide some details about achieving your goals, and it is up for the person who has been tasked with solving their problems or putting an end on something they are trying so hard attaining in life yet do not reach any mark nearing completion.*

- **Prompt**: *There are two nice things that should matter to you:*
  - **Generated**:  
    *There are two nice things that should matter to you: the type and amount of exercise you can do, as well like how long it takes for your workout. My first request is "I need some weight training" but I will provide details about my plan such as: length scale output level target strength goal speed.*

## **Comparison of Results Before and After Training**

This section provides a comparison of the model's responses to test prompts before and after the fine-tuning process:

### **Prompt**: *I want you to act as a motivational coach.*
- **Before Training**:  
  *I want you to act as a motivational coach.*
- **After Training**:  
  *I want you to act as a motivational coach. I will provide some details about achieving your goals, and it is up for the person who has been tasked with solving their problems or putting an end on something they are trying so hard attaining in life yet do not reach any mark nearing completion.*

### **Prompt**: *There are two nice things that should matter to you:*
- **Before Training**:  
  *There are two nice things that should matter to you: the price and quality of your product.*
- **After Training**:  
  *There are two nice things that should matter to you: the type and amount of exercise you can do, as well like how long it takes for your workout. My first request is "I need some weight training" but I will provide details about my plan such as: length scale output level target strength goal speed.*

## **Conclusion**

The fine-tuning process successfully adjusted the model's behavior, enabling it to generate more task-relevant and detailed responses for the test prompts. 

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Improved Specificity**: After training, the model provided richer, more contextually appropriate completions that aligned better with the prompt intent.
2. **Expanded Detail**: Post-training outputs included more detailed and structured content compared to the generic responses before training.

### **Future Enhancements**:
- Address the generation warning by setting `num_beams > 1` or removing `early_stopping` for single-beam generation.
- Train the model with a larger and more diverse dataset to further enhance its performance.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for better control over repetition and coherence.
